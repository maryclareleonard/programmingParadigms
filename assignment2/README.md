The two extensions I made were:

Ball Stuck:
- There was a few times in testing that the ball was stuck, 
bumping around in the same pattern with no chance for interaction from a goalie. 
When clicking this button the score remains the same, yet the ball returns to the center
and a random direction and speed is given. Therefore things do not favor a specific opponent, 
however the game can continue without losing progress.
- Note: I realize an obvious downfall here is that someone could use this to their favor. I was 
unsure how to check if a path is repetitive, however that would be a fun add. 

Level Up / Level Down:
- The strength of the goalie makes the game much easier or harder. The left goalie can have strength
1 to 4 (the speed of change). With the buttons you control your level, with bounds at 1 and 4.
