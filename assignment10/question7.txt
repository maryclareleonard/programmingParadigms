Clojure reminds me the most of functional programming practices which I have always personally had a hard time wrapping my head around.
Personally, I have found Clojure quite confusing, harder to pick up than other languages we have looked at in this course. I understand the idea for absolute simplicity with this language but I think it goes a bit too far. At a certain point you lose the efficiency of trying to get simple. For example, not using commas to separate passed parameters to functions sacrifices readability at an attempt for simplicity. As the programmer it is a little harder to keep track of going on without the commas, personally I do not think its worth it. I would compare it to Python in its attempt to be simple, no semicolons and the use of tabs instead of brackets. However, Python maintains elements that might be ‘superfluous’ like commas to maintain readability.
