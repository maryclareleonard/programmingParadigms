run command:
python3 SnakeGame.py

In the console log: 
Status will print based on current state
- CONTENT: "Happy as a clam!!
- ENGORGED: "GOSH I'm stuffed."
- HUNGRY: "I NEED Food!!"
Step and Meal counts will print to provide logic behind state changes.

When the game ends
"You hit yourself" or "You went out of bounds" will print dependent on cause of death.
And Total Meals Eaten will display. 
Note: This is different than what might have been printing just previously in the console 
that is a separate meals parameter that resets for state logic.
